# Rails Movies

[https://tibo-rails-movies.herokuapp.com/](https://tibo-rails-movies.herokuapp.com/)

Using `themoviedb` gem to get access to the movie database API.

We use a master key for the heroku deployment.

To install the app dependencies, start the db and seed it :
```sh
$ bundle install
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:seed
```

To start the run the app locally
```sh
$ rails s
```
